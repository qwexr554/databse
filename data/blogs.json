The integration of pharmacogenomics in clinical practice aims to shift medicine from a \"one-size-fits-all\" approach to a more precise and effective system — personalized medicine. This innovation is particularly promising in treating cancer, depression, and cardiovascular diseases."

By tailoring medications to individuals based on genetic data, healthcare providers can significantly reduce adverse drug reactions and increase treatment efficacy. This requires collaboration between pharmacologists, geneticists, and clinicians across disciplines."
